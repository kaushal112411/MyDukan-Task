Table: {
  Products: { 
    Product_Name- VARCHAR,
    Model_Name - VARCHAR,
    Product_SerialNo - VARCHAR (could be converted to INT before loading to DB),
    Group_Associated - VARCHAR (same as above, preprocessing can be done to convert),
    product_MRP - VARCHAR (same as above, proprocessing can be done to conver)
    }
   Groups_listing: {
    Group_Name - VARCHAR,
    group_description - VARCHAR,
    isActive - VARCHAR
    }
  }
  -> If we want to apply a SQL join on these tables, we can do so on the columns Products.GroupAssociated on Groups_listing.Group_Name.
  -> Possible further improvements are type castings to their implicit data types and small regex extractions to reduce redundancy.
